Assignment: 08 class-based view
Date: 5/28/23
File name: blogging/views.py
Purpose:
- convert the function-based views in your blogging app into class-based views.
Your work will be very similar to the work we did in the lesson content to create the polling class-based views, except
The blogging detail view doesn't accept POST requests, so there will be no need to create a `post` method in the blogging detail view.

Resources:

  In the Starting Django tutorial, you learned about Django urlconfs. We used our project urlconf to hook the Django admin into our project
  and we want to do the same thing for our new app. In general, an app that serves any sort of views should contain its own urlconf.
  The project urlconf should mainly include these where possible.

    front page should continue to display only published posts and it should continue to display posts in reverse-chronological order.
    To accomplish this, you'll be providing a `queryset` class attribute in your list view instead of a `model` class attribute.
